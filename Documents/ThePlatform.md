# The Klappir Platform

## The Platform Menu

The Klappir Platform is found @ [core.klappir.io(https://core.klappir.io/)]. First you will encounter a login popup -- enter your login credintials then click Log in button. The account is created by your dedicated account manager after the purchase or for the trial of the system. Your account name will appear as the first item and the four primary menu items will present below the account name (menu image).

At the top of the opening screen is the module Menu bar. You will select the modules you want to use by clicking the icons. EnviroMaster (leaf icon) is the primary module for most of our users, but many users have multiple modules in play and navigate between them easily (bar image).

## Systems

Subsystems are crucial for organizations that want to track emissions inventories over multiple companies or divisions. Subsystems allow users to view data be individual subsystems, as well as combined into the parent company overall. Users can select the subsystems in the hierarchical structure to review that systemâ€™s account.

Users assigned to specific subsystems only have access to that subsystem data and analytics. Users assigned to the Patent account have access and overview of all systems.

## Files

The Platform Document Manager is used to add documents to the projects. The documents used for compliance and conformity of International Standards such as ISO 14001 or ISO 50001 or for ships at sea providing documents to port masters.
