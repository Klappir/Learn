# The Klappir Platform

## Sustainability Management on the Klappir Platform

Our digital solutions are designed for businesses, organizations and municipalities that want to create strong infrastructure for effective sustainability management.

By streaming varied environmental data into one and the same platform we create a more reliable and detailed overview of your operational footprint than has up until now been possible. You can then use that information to greatly diminish the negative impact of your operation as well as increasing your operational efficiency by reducing waste and better managing your use of resources.

By connecting to different meters and sensors from service providers and streaming data about electricity, fuel, and hot and cold water into the Klappir Platform, as well as regularly registering information about staff flights and other activities related to the operation, we create a comprehensive overview of your energy intensity, which allows you to devise sophisticated plans for reducing your environmental footprint.  

## The Klappir Methodology

### The Greenhouse Gas Protocol

Klappir’s approach to smart environmental management uses **The Greenhouse Gas Protocol** as a point of reference.

The GHG Protocol is the most widely used international accounting tool for government and business leaders to understand, quantify, and manage greenhouse gas emissions.

Simply put, The GHG Protocol collects the standards, guidelines and tools for accounting and managing GHG emissions. The objective is to render companies, governments and organisations more efficient, resilient and prosperous by establishing a comprehensive, global standardised framework for measuring and managing GHG emissions.

The overarching goal of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol is therefore to reduce emissions and control the six anthropogenic (human-emitted) greenhouse gases outlined in the Kyoto Protocol (Japan, Dec. 1997).

[Here](https://klappir.com/blog/the-greenhouse-gas-protocol-explained) is an article on the Klappir website where we thoroughly explain the methodology behind the GHG Protocol.

### The Paris Climate Agreement

The Paris Agreement central aim is to strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change by keeping a global temperature rise this century well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5 degrees Celsius.

In 2020, the Paris Agreement takes over the Kyoto II agreement, resulting in increased pressure on businesses and governments to deliver on their commitments prior to 2030.

The main driver behind The Klappir Platform is to provide our customers with a suite of sustainability solutions that supports businesses and government bodies on every level of their journey toward sustainability and the Paris Agreement goals.

### The UN Sustainable Development Goals

The thinking behind Klappir's sustainability solutions is aligned with the UN Sustainability Development Goals.

The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015, provides a shared blueprint for peace and prosperity for people and the planet, now and into the future. At its heart are the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which are an urgent call for action by all countries - developed and developing - in a global partnership.

Our overarching aims is to help protect, sustain, and regenerate our natural resources for not only the future––but right now. Because climate change is already transforming our world with incredible speed and we need to act today. At Klappir, we contribute by leading the way in carbon footprint reporting.
