# The Klappir Platform

### The Platform Menu

The Klappir Platform is found @ core.klappir.io. First you will encounter a login popup -- enter your login credintials then click Log in button. The account is created by your dedicated account manager after the purchase or for the trial of the system. Your account name will appear as the first item and the Platform menu items will present below the account name on the left side.

At the top of the opening screen is the Klappir Module Menu bar. You will select the module you want to use by clicking the icons. EnviroMaster (leaf icon) is the primary module for most of our users, but many users have multiple modules in play and navigate between them easily.
