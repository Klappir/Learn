Welcome to Klappir EnviroMaster!

We are very happy to have you join the ever-growing group of our happy customers who use EnviroMaster for environmental accounting, sustainability management, and ESG Reporting.

Here you can find all the necessary information about how to get Klappir EnviroMaster up and running both quick and easy. 

##What Is Klappir EnviroMaster?

Klappir EnviroMaster is our flagship sustainability solution, operated on our sustainability platform. It is designed for businesses, organisations, and municipalities that want to create strong infrastructure for environmental accounting and deliver reliable ESG reporting.

EnviroMaster is a cloud-based digital solution that facilitates sustainability management by largely automating the process. It is used by organisations, municipalities, and businesses across all sectors. As the solution is cloud-based, there is no need for any installation process. You can start using it right away.

##Why Should I Be Using Klappir EnviroMaster?

If you take environmental accounting seriously, you should be using the Klappir Platform. But of course we'll tell you that––we've put countless hours into creating the very best solution possible!

Objectively, though, it is fair to say that based on the experience of working with a wide selection of clients from pretty much every industry on Earth, we've seen that if you need to deliver reliable ESG reporting of the highest order, then our sustainability platform provides all the necessary tools for you. We make the data collection easy as pie and guarantee that the reporting adheres to all the most common standards, laws and regulations. 

This means that you can focus on your most important challenge––which is maximising the sustainability of your business.

##How Do I Measure My Sustainability?

Basically, you need to have the reliable environmental data spanning your entire operation. 

First, you need a complete list of your service providers, specifically your utilities. Who supplies the company with electricity? What about the fuel for the car fleet? 

As soon as you've made that list, then you have to determine how you can obtain the necessary data. In Iceland, we do this by establishing a direct connection with service providers. It will depend on your region how you can obtain the necessary data streams and/or the necessary data.

Once that is done, organizing all the data and turning it into legible information, valid for environmetal statements or ESG reports, might sound overwhelming. But that's exactly why we created the Klappir Platform: to not only make such data processing doable, but feasible and easy. 

Which now leads us to The Klappir Dashboard. 

#The Klappir Dashboard
The Klappir Dashboard is where you have an overview of your total environmental footprint––that is, the sustainability level of your operation.
 
When all datasources have been activated, or all the data has been manually imported, the Klappir Dashboard will display your energy intensity in visually-pleasing, and easy to understand, bar charts. This gives you an unprecedented overview of the energy intensity of the whole operation. Here you will have bar charts for fuel, electricity, waste, hot and cold water, gaseous substances, and heating. We also calculate the CO2 equivalents of the emissions. 

EnviroMaster collects all this data and presents it to you through a user-friendly interface. In Iceland, we do this by establishing a direct connection with service providers. It will depend on your region how you can obtain the necessary data streams and/or information.

##tCO₂e - carbon equivalents
Carbon dioxide equivalents, also written as tCO₂e, is a measure used to compare the emissions from various greenhouse gases based upon their global warming potential. To further explain, metan (CH₄) equals 28 tCO₂e and nitrous oxide (N₂O) equals 265 28 tCO₂e .

###Overview
The Klappir methodology is based on the three scopes defined in the Greenhouse Gas Protocol. 

<b>Scope 1</b>: All direct emissions stemming from the activities of an organisation.

<b>Scope 2</b>: Indirect emissions from electricity purchased and used by the organisation. Emissions are created during the production of the energy and eventually used by the organisation.

<b>Scope 3</b>: All other indirect emissions stemming from operational activities, for example through services provided by others. Staff flights are a good example.

The Dashboard displays emissions for all three scopes.
###Analytics

By clicking on “Details” you can view a timeline displaying your emissions (released CO₂ equivalents, in tonnes) for any given year. 

For convenience, you can break the year up in months or quarters (which is helpful when delivering quarterly statements).

You can also view your cumulative emissions throughout all the years.
