# Documents

Documents are where you genereate the Statements to be used for the reporting. There templates that are already set up for you to use to produce your desired Statement. The most common Statement is the ESG for reporting according to the new NASDAQ guidelines. A number of KPIs are included in the Statement and customizing the KPIs is an option. Contacting your account manager at Klappir is the only way to add new KPIs and genereate a new Statement template.

Selecting the Statements menu item initiates the generation of the document.

## Statements

You can use the EnviroMaster data to generate statements for different reporting standareds, such as ESG, CSR, GRI and more. 

The environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria are a set of standards for a company's operations that was devloped and formalized by NASDAQ. The criteria reveals the sustainability and the environmental footprint of the operation of the company in a comparable manner to the annual financial reporting. The ESG Statement template is the primary one available at this time. Contact us if you would like to learn more about performing your ESG Statement or other reports.

You can choose to do statements for each part of the criteria (environmental/social/governance). The statements may cover multiple years, currrent year, quarter of a year, or a single month, by applying the various filters at the top of the Statement. Review each section of the Statement is done through navigation of the heading tabs at the top of the statement.

Note that you have to manually enter certain information/paradigms, such as number of square meters, equity, number of staff, etc in the Operational Parameters in order for the KPIs to calculate and the Social/Governance reporting too. 

The statement can be exported as either Excel file or PDFs (upper right corner).
