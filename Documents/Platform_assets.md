## How to create assets

Assets form the base of the companyâ€™s measurable data that makes up the carbon emissions inventory. Making a list of your assets that are generating the emissions is a good first step. Once you have a list of assets you are ready to start using the system.
For us to be able to create a reliable, transparent overview of your carbon footprint, it is vital that you leave nothing out when registering your assets. (image side menu-Assets)

  1. Click the menu item, Assets, to open the assets manager. 
  2. Click the New Asset button to create a new asset. You can create or register your assets in different ways, depending on the modules you are using and your location         (Manual, Bulk upload and API).
  3. Manually entering each asset is the common means for EnviroMaster users at this time who are located outside of Iceland. If you are only using the EnviroMaster, click the Manual button. If using other modules, jump to that Section for further instructions.(image manual-api)
  4. Select the type of asset you are creating from the dropdown menu. Your choices are:
      - Vehicle
      - Structure
      - Ship
      - Aircraft
      - Other
  5. Enter the correct text in each of the Required Fields and remember to use a unique registration number for each asset, as this is how the system will identify each one. The Optional Fields are up to you.(image new asset popup) 
  6. Click the Insert button to complete.
