# Systems

## Subsystems

Subsystems are crucial for organizations that want to track emissions inventories over multiple companies or divisions. Subsystems allow users to view data be individual subsystems, as well as combined into the parent company overall. Users can select the subsystems in the hierarchical structure to review that systemâ€™s account.

Users assigned to specific subsystems only have access to that subsystem data and analytics. Users assigned to the Patent account have access and overview of all systems.
