# The Klappir Dashboard

EnviroMaster collects all your environmental data and presents it to you through a user-friendly interface on the Klappir Dashboard. Here is where you have a comphrehensive overview of your total environmental footprint – that is, the overall sustainability of your operation. This unprecedented overview of your energy intensity should cover your whole operation. Here you have bar charts for fuel, electricity, waste, hot and cold water, gaseous substances, and heating. Based on all this data, we are then able to calculate the CO2 equivalents of your total emissions.

## tCO₂e - carbon equivalents

Carbon dioxide equivalents, also written as tCO₂e, is a measure used to compare the emissions from various greenhouse gases based upon their global warming potential. To give an example, metan (CH₄) equals 28 tCO₂e and nitrous oxide (N₂O) equals 265 28 tCO₂e.

### Overview

The Klappir methodology is based on the three scopes defined in the Greenhouse Gas Protocol. 

<b>Scope 1</b>: All direct emissions stemming from the activities of an organisation.

<b>Scope 2</b>: Indirect emissions from electricity purchased and used by the organisation. Emissions are created during the production of the energy and eventually used by the organisation.

<b>Scope 3</b>: All other indirect emissions stemming from operational activities, for example through services provided by others. Staff flights are a good example.

The Dashboard displays emissions for all three scopes.
###Analytics

By clicking on “Details” you can view a timeline displaying your emissions (released CO₂ equivalents, in tonnes) for any given year. 

For convenience, you can break the year up in months or quarters (which is helpful when delivering quarterly statements).

You can also view your cumulative emissions throughout all the years.
