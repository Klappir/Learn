# The EnviroMaster Dashboard

EnviroMaster collects all your environmental data and presents it to you through a user-friendly interface on the Klappir Dashboard.

![alt text](https://klappir-static.s3.amazonaws.com/img/learn/EnviroMasterDashboard.png)

Here is where you have a comphrehensive overview of your total environmental footprint – that is, the overall sustainability of your operation. This unprecedented overview of your energy intensity should cover your whole business operation. 

On the Dashboard you have bar charts for fuel, electricity, waste, hot and cold water, gaseous substances, and heating. Based on the data, we are then able to calculate the CO2 equivalents of your total emissions.

## tCO₂e - What are carbon equivalents?

Carbon dioxide equivalents, also written tCO₂e, is a measure used to compare the emissions from various greenhouse gases based upon their global warming potential. To give an example, metan (CH₄) equals 28 tCO₂e and nitrous oxide (N₂O) equals 265 28 tCO₂e.

### Details
The Klappir methodology is based on the three scopes defined in the Greenhouse Gas Protocol. 

<b>Scope 1</b>: All direct emissions stemming from the activities of an organisation.

<b>Scope 2</b>: Indirect emissions from electricity purchased and used by the organisation. Emissions are created during the production of the energy and eventually used by the organisation.

<b>Scope 3</b>: All other indirect emissions stemming from operational activities, for example through services provided by others. Staff flights are a good example.

The Dashboard displays emissions for all three scopes.

### Analytics

By clicking on “Details” you can view a timeline displaying your emissions (released CO₂ equivalents, in tonnes) for any given year. 

For convenience, you can break the year up in months or quarters (which is helpful when delivering quarterly statements).

You can also view your cumulative emissions throughout all the years.

## Fuel

View your fuel consumption in either kilograms or litres.

### Details

View your fuel intensity for individual years, single months or yearly quarters.  

![alt text](https://klappir-static.s3.amazonaws.com/img/learn/FuelDetails.png)

This is a great tool for keeping track of how your goals for reducing your footprint are going and spot opportunities for improvement.

### Analytics

Here is where you can delve deeper into the fuel data and customise what is displayed on the dashboard.

![alt text](https://klappir-static.s3.amazonaws.com/img/learn/FuelAnalytics.png)

Choose the date range you want to look at

![alt text](https://klappir-static.s3.amazonaws.com/img/learn/FuelAnalyticsDateRange.png)

and either view all assets or select asset type.

![alt text](https://klappir-static.s3.amazonaws.com/img/learn/FuelAnalyticsAssetType.png)

You can also break your assets into groups (e.g. by location or organisational structure)

![alt text](https://klappir-static.s3.amazonaws.com/img/learn/FuelAnalyticsAssetGroups.png)

and view individual assets, such as specific vehicles.

![alt text](https://klappir-static.s3.amazonaws.com/img/learn/FuelAnalyticsAllAssets.png)

The fun, however, is in customising what is displayed on the dashboard. 

First of all, you can choose what is shown on the bar chart

![alt text](https://klappir-static.s3.amazonaws.com/img/learn/FuelStack.png)

and you can select both the x value

![alt text](https://klappir-static.s3.amazonaws.com/img/learn/FuelXvalue.png)

and the y value.

![alt text](https://klappir-static.s3.amazonaws.com/img/learn/FuelYvalue.png)

To give an example, this is how the fuel data is displayed when stacked by asset and with x value as months and the y value as carbon equivalents in kg.

![alt text](https://klappir-static.s3.amazonaws.com/img/learn/FuelBarChartExample.png) 

Another example: Here you have an overview which shows the type and amount of both diesel and petrol you are buying from different fuel suppliers.

![alt text](https://klappir-static.s3.amazonaws.com/img/learn/FuelBarChartExample2.png) 

Experiment with these feature as much as you like and ask our service team for assistance if you need it. We're here to help!

## Electricity

Next you have an overview of your total electricity consumption. 

![alt text](https://klappir-static.s3.amazonaws.com/img/learn/Electricity.59.png)

### Details

View your electricity intensity for individual years, single months or yearly quarters.  

![alt text](https://klappir-static.s3.amazonaws.com/img/learn/ElectricityDetails.png)

This is a great place for keeping track of how your goals for reducing your footprint are going and helps you spot opportunities for improvement.

### Analytics

Here is where you can delve deeper into the electricity data.

![alt text](https://klappir-static.s3.amazonaws.com/img/learn/ElectricityAnalytics.png)

Choose the date range you want to look at

![alt text](https://klappir-static.s3.amazonaws.com/img/learn/ElectricityDateRange.png)

and select the unit for displaying the electricity consumption. You can view it in kilowatt-hours (kWh) or have us convert it into kilograms of carbon equivalents (kgCO2e) or tonnes of carbon equivalents (tCO2e).

![alt text](https://klappir-static.s3.amazonaws.com/img/learn/+ElectricityUnit.png)

You can also select asset groups

![alt text](https://klappir-static.s3.amazonaws.com/img/learn/ElectricityAssetGroups.png) 

or look at individual assets.

![alt text](https://klappir-static.s3.amazonaws.com/img/learn/ElectricityIndividualAssets.png) 

The analytics tools allow you to compare the energy consumption in different workstations and buildings, compare your electricity consumption over different monthts, quarters and years, and seek opportunities for improvements.

## Waste

Our customers have cut their operational costs by large amounts simply by getting serious about sorting their waste. 

![alt text](https://klappir-static.s3.amazonaws.com/img/learn/Waste.13.png)

![alt text](https://klappir-static.s3.amazonaws.com/img/learn/WasteDetails.png)

This is where you keep track of how your goals for reducing your footprint are going and helps you spot opportunities for better sorting your waste as well as reducing it.

### Analytics

Here is where you can delve deeper into the waste data.

![alt text](https://klappir-static.s3.amazonaws.com/img/learn/WasteAnalytics1.png)

Choose the date range you want to look at

You can also view individual locations 

![alt text](https://klappir-static.s3.amazonaws.com/img/learn/WasteLocation.png)

or several handpicked ones. Here's an example with three locations:

![alt text](https://klappir-static.s3.amazonaws.com/img/learn/WasteThreeLocations1.png)

You can also select the type of waste you want to look at.

![alt text](https://klappir-static.s3.amazonaws.com/img/learn/WasteType.png)

**EWC code** is the code used to identify waste as listed in the *European Waste Catalogue*.

![alt text](https://klappir-static.s3.amazonaws.com/img/learn/WasteEWCCode.png)

It is sometimes also referred to as LoW (List of Waste) or Waste Classification Code. All waste produced will have a corresponding EWC code.

Finally, you can choose which service providers.
