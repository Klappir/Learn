# The EnviroMaster Module

The Klappir EnviroMaster is a SaaS solution (module) on the Core.Klappir.io platform designed to help you create strong infrastructure for smart environmental management and sustainability practices. By streaming or importing operational consumption data into the centralized database of the platform you create a more reliable and detailed overview of your operational footprint. The Dashboard, graphs and charts provide detailed insight and discovery you can then analyse for increasing your operational efficiency by reducing waste and excess consumption.

Streaming transactional consumption data into the Klappir Platform is the best means to ensure consistency, accuracy, and transparency in GHG accounting. By connecting to smart meters and sensors, as well as suppliers and service providers through APIs, user errors are reduced and costs of compiling the emissions inventory is greatly reduced.

Technically you can measure any type of operational consumption and waste production. But let’s start at the beginning to get the consumption data flowing into the system and identifying the assets generating the consumption and waste.

The EnviroMaster module icon is a leaf in the horizontal menu bar at the top of the page. The other icons in the menu bar are other Klappir solutions.

# The EnviroMaster Dashboard

EnviroMaster is a collection of all your consumption data presented in a user-friendly interface starting with the Klappir Dashboard. **Insights** is the menu item for EnviroMaster's Dashboard. Each category, side menu or on the Dashboard, are clickable and open the analytics for each.

![EnviroMaster Dashboard](https://klappir-static.s3.amazonaws.com/img/learn/EnviroMaster-Insights-Dashboard.png)

The Dashboard is a clear and comphrehensive overview of your total environmental footprint – that is, the overall sustainability of your operation. This unprecedented overview of your energy intensity should cover your whole business operation.

On the Dashboard you have bar charts for fuel, electricity, waste, hot and cold water, gaseous substances, and heating. Based on the data, we are then able to calculate the CO2 equivalents of your total emissions.

### tCO₂e - What are carbon equivalents?

Carbon dioxide equivalents, also written tCO₂e, is a measure used to compare the emissions from various greenhouse gases based upon their global warming potential. To give an example, metan (CH₄) equals 28 tCO₂e and nitrous oxide (N₂O) equals 265 28 tCO₂e.

![tCO2e Emisssions chart](https://klappir-static.s3.amazonaws.com/img/learn/Carbon+equivalents.png)

The Klappir methodology is based on the three scopes defined in the Greenhouse Gas Protocol. The Dashboard displays emissions for all three scopes.

**Scope 1**: All direct emissions stemming from the activities of an organisation.

**Scope 2**: Indirect emissions from electricity purchased and used by the organisation. Emissions are created during the production of the energy and eventually used by the organisation.

**Scope 3**: All other indirect emissions stemming from operational activities, for example through services provided by others. Staff flights are a good example.

# Insights

Insights is the term the Klappir EnviroMaster uses for the Analytics breakdowns. Each consumption category includes 3 tabs for the analytics:
  - Overview
  - Summary
  - Transactions
  
Each of these has a number of filters available for reviewing cumulative data for the year or comparison of specific assets energy intensity.

## Fuel

### Overview

The first tab view in your fuel consumption is the Overview and here you can deep dive into the fuel data and customise what is displayed on the Overview. The Overview displays the collection of bar graphs with pie charts for analysis. For convenience, you can select Date Range, Asset Types, Asset Groups, and Suppliers for comparison. You can also view your cumulative emissions throughout all the years you have data for.

The X Value and Y Value are the filters used to compare your asset consumption and the emissions released CO₂ equivalents, in tonnes.

![alt text](https://klappir-static.s3.amazonaws.com/img/learn/Fuel-Overview.png)

This is a great tool for keeping track of how your goals for reducing your footprint are going and spot opportunities for improvement.

Choose the date range you want to look at

![alt text](https://klappir-static.s3.amazonaws.com/img/learn/FuelAnalyticsDateRange.png)

and either view all assets or select asset type.

![alt text](https://klappir-static.s3.amazonaws.com/img/learn/FuelAnalyticsAssetType.png)

You can also break your assets into groups (e.g. by location or organisational structure)

![alt text](https://klappir-static.s3.amazonaws.com/img/learn/FuelAnalyticsAssetGroups.png)

and view individual assets, such as specific vehicles.

![alt text](https://klappir-static.s3.amazonaws.com/img/learn/FuelAnalyticsAllAssets.png)

The fun, however, is in customising what is displayed on the Overview and the deep-diving analysis to discover how to decrease emisssions quickly.

First of all, you can choose what is shown on the bar chart

![alt text](https://klappir-static.s3.amazonaws.com/img/learn/FuelStack.png)

and you can select both the x value

![alt text](https://klappir-static.s3.amazonaws.com/img/learn/FuelXvalue.png)

and the y value.

![alt text](https://klappir-static.s3.amazonaws.com/img/learn/FuelYvalue.png)

To give an example, this is how the fuel data is displayed when stacked by asset and with x value as months and the y value as carbon equivalents in kg.

![alt text](https://klappir-static.s3.amazonaws.com/img/learn/FuelBarChartExample.png)

Another example: Here you have an overview which shows the type and amount of both diesel and petrol you are buying from different fuel suppliers.

# Documents

Documents are where you genereate the Statements to be used for the reporting. There templates that are already set up for you to use to produce your desired Statement. The most common Statement is the ESG for reporting according to the new NASDAQ guidelines. A number of KPIs are included in the Statement and customizing the KPIs is an option. Contacting your account manager at Klappir is the only way to add new KPIs and genereate a new Statement template.

Selecting the Statements menu item initiates the generation of the document.

## Statements

You can use the EnviroMaster data to generate statements for different reporting standareds, such as ESG, CSR, GRI and more. 

The environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria are a set of standards for a company's operations that was devloped and formalized by NASDAQ. The criteria reveals the sustainability and the environmental footprint of the operation of the company in a comparable manner to the annual financial reporting. The ESG Statement template is the primary one available at this time. Contact us if you would like to learn more about performing your ESG Statement or other reports.

You can choose to do statements for each part of the criteria (environmental/social/governance). The statements may cover multiple years, currrent year, quarter of a year, or a single month, by applying the various filters at the top of the Statement. Review each section of the Statement is done through navigation of the heading tabs at the top of the statement.

(image statement-tabs)

Note that you have to manually enter certain information/paradigms, such as number of square meters, equity, number of staff, etc in the Operational Parameters in order for the KPIs to calculate and the Social/Governance reporting too. 

The statement can be exported as either Excel file or PDFs (upper right corner).
